# Matias-Portfolio-2025
üë®‚Äçüíª Hi, my name is Matias. After graduating in 2023, I was inspired by my internship and work at CapitaLand and Atome to dive into Fintech and Programming

This repository showcases FinTech-oriented projects that explore how coding can enhance financial-related tasks. 
- Projects utilize Python, ML, HTML, CSS, Streamlit, Power BI, and more
- Spans from entry to mid-level proficiency

## üèÜ Main Projects
### BTO Price Predictor (Streamlit, ML, Python)
As a young adult, i noticed that my peers felt overwhelmed by the idea of purchasing a BTO, I developed a user-friendly Streamlit app to assist in financial planning and awareness.
- Price Prediction Mode using ML.
- Budget-Based Flat Recommendation System to match users' budgets with suitable flat
- Live Demo: [BTO Price Prediction App](https://bto-price-prediction-app-matiasfong.streamlit.app/)

### Fintech Foundations and Applications (Python)
Inspired by a Fintech course I completed, this project summarizes key learning points into a user-friendly course program.
- 4 Specializations with 80+ segments of structured course material.
- Intuitive navigation via a main panel with "Specializations-Topics-Segments," back functions, and clean visuals.

### Expense Budgeting Tracker Sandbox (Python)
A personal finance tracker designed to track and budget expenses categorically.
- View/Edit expenses in a separate CSV file.
- Set budgets, track remaining budgets, and calculate average daily expenses.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Projects
Stock Price Prediction (Jupyter Notebook)
### After completing Andrew Ng's Stanford ML Course, I applied various ML algorithms to predict stock prices:
1. S&P 500: Random Forest Classifier.
2. Tesla: Linear Regression.
3. Google: LSTM.

## üíª Web Development
Fin-Dex (HTML, CSS)
Developed an interactive Fintech blog website for my CS50 assignment, exploring the ABCDs of Fintech (AI, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Big Data).
Features:
